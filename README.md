# python-assignment-6

## This repository contains **50 Python questions with solutions**, covering important beginner-to-intermediate concepts. Each file (`answer1.py` → `answer50.py`) contains **one question and its solution**, making it easy to practice step by step.


## Topics Covered

1. **Positional Arguments**

   * Understanding order of arguments in functions
   * Common mistakes and fixes

2. **Keyword Arguments**

   * Passing values with `key=value` format
   * Mixing positional & keyword arguments

3. **The `return` Statement**

* Each file is **standalone** (you can run it directly).

* File names follow the format: `answerX.py` where `X` is the question number.


## 🏆 Goal

The main purpose of this repo is to **practice Python fundamentals** through hands-on Q\&A. By the end, you’ll have a solid understanding of:

* How functions work
* How arguments are passed
* How values are returned
* How variable scope affects execution
